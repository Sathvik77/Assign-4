                        <p>The age of the electric car is upon us. Earlier this year, the US automobile giant General Motors announced that it aims
                         to stop selling petrol-powered and diesel models by 2035. Audi, based in Germany, plans to stop producing such vehicles by 2033.
                         Many other automotive multinationals have issued similar road maps. Suddenly, major carmakersâ€™ foot-dragging on electrifying their
                        fleets is turning into a rush for the exit. The electrification of personal mobility is picking up speed in a way that even its most
                        ardent proponents might not have dreamt of just a few years ago. In many countries, government mandates will accelerate change. But
                        even without new policies or regulations, half of global passenger-vehicle sales in 2035 will be electric, according to the 
                        BloombergNEF (BNEF) consultancy in London.</p>
